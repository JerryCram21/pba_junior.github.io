        <h1>Tough road for TNT begins with Barako Bull</h1><br><br>
                <p><h4>If there’s is one thing TNT coach Jong Uichico is grateful for, it’s his Tropang Texters’ assignments in the Smart Bro-PBA Philippine Cup.<br><br>

“Mabuti na lang hindi kasing bigat, katulad sa iba,” said Uichico. “I mean, hindi sunod-sunod na malalakas ang kalaban at hindi ganu’ng ka-dikit-dikit. Tuloy, nagkakaroon kami ng enough time to recover in-between games.”<br><br>

Things are about to change for TNT following its collision with Barako Bull Thursday as they enter the homestretch of the 11-game eliminations at the Mall of Asia Arena.<br><br>

The Tropang Texters are gunning for a second straight win and fifth in seven games overall as they try to keep within striking distance of a top two finish or, at least, hold on to a spot among the top six.<br><br>

The top two teams after the elims are rewarded with automatic semifinals berths while the third to sixth-ranked teams enjoy a win-once advantage over their foes in the first phase of the quarterfinals.<br><br>

The Energy, on the other hand, would be content to just snap out of a two-game slide before looking forward to what could be a rollercoaster ride in their last elims assignments.<br><br>

First, Barako must re-gather its bearings following back-to-back losses to defending champion San Miguel Beer and another pre-tournament favorite in Rain or Shine, the last via a 104-110 count last Friday.<br><br>

Energy coach Koy Banal is hoping his charges could draw lessons from their experience against the Elasto Painters and use them to good stead against the Texters.<br><br>

“We’re hoping that we learned something about our last game against Rain or Shine. They (TNT) are pretty much the same in terms of players’ skills,” said Banal.<br><br>

Much as Uichico wants to focus on the task at hand, he can’t help but look at their forthcoming games dotted by the likes of the E-Painters, Beermen, GlobalPort Batang Pier and Barangay Ginebra Kings, making it imperative for his players to fully put their acts together.<br><br>

“It will be a tough road ahead,” stressed Uichico.<br><br>

What should give TNT momentum is its 109-98 victory over Blackwater last week, when Jayson Castro led the attack with 26 points, newbies Troy Rosario and Moala Tautuaa combined for 33 points and 18 rebounds and the Texters ultimately found their rhythm in the second half for a cruising win.<br><br>

“Their two rookies re giving them good numbers,” said Banal of the top two picks overall in the draft, who are both usually good for more than 24 points and a little over 14 boards per outing.<br><br>

Ryan Roose Garcia has been doing his part for Barako with 16.43 points per game and so does workhorse Willy Wilson (14.71 points, 11.86 rebounds, 3.14 assists). It’s just a matter of them hitting their stride along with JC Intal, Josh Urbiztondo and Mick Pennisi, to name but a few Energy.<br><br>

Banal said it should all be about his players working their butts off on both ends of the court. “The plan is to stay basic on both ends. We have to be smart in our shot selections and to be active defensively,” he said.<br><br>
